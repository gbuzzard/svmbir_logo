# svmbir_logo

This package generates the svmbir logo from individual elements.  

The sinogram "S" is generated from a radon transform of the 
image in images/svmbir.png.  

The output logo is contained in logo.png.  For use with Sphinx, 
this must be converted to an svg file.  One way to do this is to 
create a pdf from the png file, then use https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-svg/
to convert from pdf to svg.
